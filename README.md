# Restaurant POS & Operations Platform

Multi-outlet restaurant POS, kitchen (KOT), menu/catalog, online aggregator integration, inventory, finance, CRM and reporting platform.

**Status:** Phase 0 — Discovery. No development starts until `docs/01-discovery/decision-register.md` items DEC-001..DEC-012 are signed off.

## 👉 Developers: read [`docs/START-HERE.md`](docs/START-HERE.md) before writing any code.

It is the single entry point — system overview, role-based reading order, what is blocked by which decision, and the pre-code checklist. Then [`docs/ENGINEERING-PROTOCOL.md`](docs/ENGINEERING-PROTOCOL.md) for the rules that govern every PR.
